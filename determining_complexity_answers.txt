  1)  O(1).

  2)  O(n). It will run through once, finding the largest number in the collection. There is no other real work do be done with it.

  3)  O(n). Like the example in #2, it will only run through the collection once. Even though it's a 2D array, that doesn't change how many times it will run.

  4)  Exponential is the closest.

  5)  O(n). The temp, num1, num2 items have nothing to do wth how many operations are run. It's all about n and i.

  6)  The Big O is exponential. It is a quick sort
